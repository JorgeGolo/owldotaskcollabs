        What Are Cookies?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer,
        tablet, or mobile) when you visit our website. They allow us to
        recognize your device and remember certain information about your visit,
        such as your preferences and actions on our site. Cookies are widely
        used to make websites work more efficiently and provide valuable
        information to website owners.

        Types of Cookies We Use
      </h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4 mb-3">
        1. Essential Cookies
      </h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        These cookies are necessary for the functioning of our website and
        cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in
        response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services,
        such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in
        forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these
        cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Performance Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can
        measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know
        which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move
        around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and
        therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know
        when you have visited our site.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Functionality Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and
        personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose
        services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies,
        then some or all of these services may not function properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our site uses Firebase Authentication to enable login and registration
        via Google. This process requires the installation of cookies managed by
        Google LLC. If the user does not provide consent for the use of
        third-party cookies, login or registration via Google will not be
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cookies used by Google include, among others: SID, HSID, SSID,
        SAPISID, APISID, NID, AEC, and secure variants such as _Secure-1PAPISID,
        etc. You can view Googleâ€™s cookie policy here.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners
        (such as Google AdSense). They may be used by those companies to build a
        profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.
        They do not directly store personal information but are based on
        uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not
        allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
      </p>
